Now, It's a matter of user's permissions, The binary present in the home directory seems to run commands with effective uid for bandit20 
```bash
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do 
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do id
uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) euid=11020(bandit20) groups=11019(bandit19)
```
Which means we can read the file in /etc/bandit_pass as if we were the user bandit20
```bash
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
